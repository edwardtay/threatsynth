## Recording Instructions

- Screen record at 1280x720 or 1920x1080
- Start backend: `cd /home/ed0x/deriv-ai-hackathon && venv/bin/uvicorn backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`
- Start frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
- Open browser to http://localhost:5173
- Use OBS Studio or similar for screen + voice recording
- Speak slowly and clearly — judges watch dozens of videos

## Scene 1: Hook (0:00 — 0:20)

**[Show: Cover image or title slide]**

> "Security teams today face an impossible challenge: over 3,500 new CVEs are published every month across dozens of disconnected feeds. Meanwhile, they're running separate tools for vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, and reporting — all manually stitched together."
>
> "ThreatSynth AI changes this. One platform. Six real intelligence sources. Four autonomous agents. Zero fake data."

---

## Scene 2: Architecture Overview (0:20 — 0:50)

**[Show: Architecture slide (slide 4)]**

> "Here's how it works. ThreatSynth runs a four-phase autonomous pipeline:"
>
> "Phase one — a Recon Agent scans targets with nmap, whatweb, and wafw00f to map the attack surface."
>
> "Phase two — a Vulnerability Scanner runs nikto, sqlmap, and security header checks."
>
> "Phase three — and this is key — an Exploit Validator tests confirmed vulnerabilities, but ONLY after a human approves each action. This is our responsible AI gate."
>
> "Phase four — an AI Reporter generates executive briefings using a local LLM. No data leaves your network."

---

## Scene 3: Live Demo — Threat Intelligence (0:50 — 1:40)

**[Show: Browser on Threats page → click "Ingest Threats"]**

> "Let me show you the threat intelligence pipeline live."
>
> "I click 'Ingest Threats' and ThreatSynth calls six real APIs in sequence..."

**[Show: Ingestion results appearing — 118 threats]**

> "NVD — the National Vulnerability Database — returns 20 CVEs."
> "CISA KEV — known exploited vulnerabilities — 30 more."
> "ExploitDB, GitHub Security Advisories, Shodan CVE Database, and FIRST.org EPSS for exploit prediction scoring."
>
> "118 real threats total. 56 critical. 59 actively exploited. All from live, free APIs — no API keys, no fake data."

**[Show: Filter by source — click "Shodan", then "GreyNoise"]**

> "Notice the Shodan source pulls CVEs with KEV status, CVSS scores, and even ransomware campaign data. The EPSS source ranks threats by actual exploitation probability — this is what attackers are targeting right now."

---

## Scene 4: Live Demo — Asset Correlation (1:40 — 2:20)

**[Show: Assets page → import YAML with 6 enterprise assets]**

> "Now I import my infrastructure assets — Apache, PostgreSQL, Jenkins, GitLab, Redis, Nginx — via YAML."

**[Show: Briefings page → click "Generate Briefings"]**

> "When I generate briefings, ThreatSynth automatically correlates 118 threats against my 6 assets by vendor and product matching."
>
> "It found 7 critical matches — Jenkins CVE-2024-23897, GitLab CVE-2021-22205, Apache CVE-2020-1938..."

**[Show: A briefing detail with priority score, remediation, business impact]**

> "Each briefing includes a priority score out of 10, specific remediation steps, and a business impact assessment — all generated by the local LLM."
>
> "My Jenkins server is at priority 10 out of 10. The briefing tells me exactly what to patch, what credentials to rotate, and what the business risk is if I don't."

## Scene 5: Differentiators & Close (2:20 — 3:00)

**[Show: "Why ThreatSynth" slide]**

> "What makes ThreatSynth different from existing tools?"
>
> "First — it's unified. No other open-source tool combines threat intelligence ingestion WITH autonomous pentesting AND AI briefing generation in one platform."
>
> "Second — it's self-hosted. The LLM runs locally via Ollama. No cloud APIs, no data exfiltration risk. This matters for defense, healthcare, and financial institutions."
>
> "Third — it's responsible. The human approval gate before exploitation means AI advises, humans decide. Every action is logged via WebSocket streaming."
>
> "ThreatSynth AI. Real threats. Real APIs. Real protection."

> "Thank you."
